+ Project summary: In this project, our team studies the machine learning fariness by implementing the algorithms of Learning Fair Representations (LFR), Constrained Support Vector Machines (C-SVM) and Constrained Logistic Regression (CLR) on the COMPAS dataset. We further evaluate and compare those three algorithms by looking into four matrices: accuracy, calibration, parity and equality of odds.
