# Project 4: Machine Learning Fairness

### [Project Description](doc/project4_desc.md)

Term: Fall 2022

+ Team #1
+ Projec title: Machine Learning Fairness (LFR, CLR, C-SVM)
+ Team members
	+ Barker, Nicolas
	+ Fang, Jiaxi
	+ Moustafa-Fahmy, Nour
	+ Yin, Yuli
	+ Zhao, Yizhou
+ Project summary: In this project, our team studies the machine learning fariness by implementing the algorithms of Learning Fair Representations (LFR), Constrained Support Vector Machines (C-SVM) and Constrained Logistic Regression (CLR) on the COMPAS dataset. We further evaluate and compare those three algorithms by looking into four matrices: accuracy, calibration, parity and equality of odds. 
	
**Contribution statement**: All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement. Kindly note Yuli worked on the functionality of the LFR model which is included in the final code. Nour worked on training all three algorithms and evaluating their metrics, and the final code presented is the product of that, as well as Nour's code for the SVM and logistic regression model.
